  <p>About Me</p>
<div class="block">
  <p class="text">Hello, I am Charlie. I am a senior majoring in graphic design. I've spent most of my time in elementary and secondary school living in NOVA, but moved to Glen Allen about a year and a half ago. Outside of class, I enjoy running laps around Monroe Park and playing video games.</p>
