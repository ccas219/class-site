    <h1>AURA: Being Tired</h1>
    <p>It doesn’t matter what type of tired consumes you. It could be a physical tired, or maybe you’re mentally tired. Being able to close your eyes, and awaken to something new, something completely different. Not having to worry about how the thing changed, just enjoying the change for a while, becoming tired of it, and closing your eyes again to hope to see something new. A change in size, shape, color, hue, brightness, text, anything to ease the viewer for a few moments.<p>
