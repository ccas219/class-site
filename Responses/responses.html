          <p>This is a website sketch based on <em><a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">My Website is a Shifting House</a></em> by Laurel Schwulst. The concept behind the sketch is a "neighborhood" that grows based on the number of people visiting. After a certain number of visitors, new houses are built and sold to anyone who wants to own a home. Home-owners are able to open their homes to visitors at any time for any occasion.</p>

          <p>This is a website sketch based on <em><a href="http://avant.org/project/hello-world/">Hello, World!</em></a> by Taeyoon Choi. Choi talked about how computers use binary to work, and humans do as well. However, as humans we also have the in-betweens. Choi explained how "light and dark" is the human version of a computer's "0 and 1", but humans also have things like "dawn and dusk" which work as in-betweens. The idea behind this website sketch telling the time through binary and color. The example on the site simply says "The time is 5:00 p.m.", but you wouldn't knwo that unless you looked it up. However, you could assume it was sunrise or sunset by the color of the sky in the background.</p>
